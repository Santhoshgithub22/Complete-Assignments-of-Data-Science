    "Some New Features Added in Python 3.8 Version are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Walrus Operator__: This operator is used to assign and return a value in the same expression. This removes the need for initializing the variable upfront. The major benefit of this is it saves some lines of code. It is also known as The __Walrus Operator__ due to its similarity to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.\n",
    "\n",
    "__yield__ and __return__ statements do not require parentheses to return multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed works with a dictionary. The built-in method __reversed()__ can be used for accessing the elements in the reverse order of insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dict comprehensions__ have been modified so that the key is computed first and the value second.\n",
    "\n",
    "__importlib_metadata__ is a new library added in the Python’s standard utility modules, that provides an API for accessing an installed package’s metadata, such as its entry points or its top-level name.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings now support = , to make string interpolation easy. Python 3.8 allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal sign (=) inside the f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the three-argument form of __pow()__, when the exponent is -1, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the given value\n",
    "\n",
    "The __csv.DictReader__ now returns instances of dictionary instead of a __collections.OrderedDict__.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you miss a comma in your code such as a = __[(1, 2) (3, 4)]__, instead of throwing __TypeError__, it displays an informative Syntax warning."
