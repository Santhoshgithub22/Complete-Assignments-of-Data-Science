    "In Python, map(), reduce(), filter(), and zip() are built-in functions used for various data manipulation and transformation tasks. Here's a brief overview of each function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* map(function, iterable): The map() function applies a given function to each element of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns an iterator that yields the results. It takes two arguments: the function to be applied and the iterable on which the function should be applied. The map() function is useful when you want to apply the same operation or transformation to every item in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* reduce(function, iterable): The reduce() function is part of the functools module in Python. It applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable and returns a single value. The function should take two arguments and perform a specific operation on them. The result is then used as the first argument for the next element in the iterable until all elements are processed. The reduce() function is useful for aggregating or combining data in a specific manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "* filter(function, iterable): The filter() function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a given function returns True. It takes two arguments: the function that performs the filtering operation and the iterable to be filtered. The function should return a Boolean value, and only elements for which the function returns True are included in the resulting iterator. The filter() function is useful for selecting specific elements from an iterable based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "* zip(*iterables): The zip() function takes multiple iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) and returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each iterable. It groups corresponding elements together into tuples, where the first tuple contains the first elements from each iterable, the second tuple contains the second elements, and so on. The resulting iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted. The zip() function is useful when you want to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions provide powerful tools for data manipulation, transformation, filtering, and aggregation in Python, helping to write concise and efficient code."
